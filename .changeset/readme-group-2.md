Rewrite the READMEs of `@editora/light-code-editor`, `@editora/themes`, `@editora/ui-core`, `@editora/ui-react`, `@editora/ui-sortable` and `@editora/toast`, which are the npm pages of these packages, with screenshots and examples.

Their images and links were relative paths that npm cannot show, and several examples did not run. Every example is now a file that is type-checked in strict mode and run in Chromium (React ones under `StrictMode`, drag and drop with the pointer and the keyboard), and the README quotes it word for word (`npm run check:readme-examples`). The screenshots are taken from the same examples (`npm run readme:screenshots`).

Things the READMEs now get right that they did not: the `@editora/themes` tokens only set text, border and shadow colours (backgrounds are set by rules), the helpers it exports are documented; `@editora/ui-core` and `@editora/ui-react` list measured bundle sizes (a Button imported from the `@editora/ui-react` root is 1 MB gzipped up front, from its own entry 54 KB up front plus the rest of `ui-core` loaded later); `@editora/toast` documents its defaults (bottom right, four seconds, three visible, theme `system`) and that it is safe to import on the server.
