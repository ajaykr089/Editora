Fix the shared `InlineMenu` React component (used by any `type: "inline-menu"` toolbar item - currently Capitalization and Text Alignment) rendering with its hardcoded light colors even inside a dark-themed editor. The existing dark-mode CSS only matched via an ancestor selector (`[data-theme="dark"] .rte-inline-menu`); despite the menu remaining a DOM descendant of the dark-themed wrapper (it uses `position: fixed` for placement, not a body portal), the menu was still painting with its light-theme background live in the browser. Fixed by having the component itself detect the dark-theme context from its anchor button (the same approach `@editora/mentions` and the newly-fixed `@editora/slash-commands` use) and apply an explicit `rte-inline-menu-theme-dark` class, with matching CSS added as a robust fallback alongside the existing ancestor-selector rule. Verified live: correctly dark in a dark-themed editor, unchanged (light) in a light-themed one.
