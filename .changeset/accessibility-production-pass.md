An accessibility and layout pass over the UI components, measured with axe-core over all 602 Storybook stories (292 stories had violations; 24 remain, all listed under "Known limits"). The names pass from the previous release stays at 0 unnamed controls.

**Descriptions and names now reach the control**

- A `ui-field` description and error were pointed at with ids inside the field's shadow root, which the control can never follow. The field now puts their text on the control as `aria-description`. `ui-input`, `ui-textarea`, `ui-number-field`, `ui-password-field`, `ui-tags-input`, `ui-combobox`, `ui-select`, `ui-multi-select`, `ui-pin-input`, `ui-date-field`, `ui-time-field` and the date pickers forward it (and an `aria-describedby` the author put on the host) to the element inside them. `ui-tags-input` now wires its own description and error too.
- `ui-dock` items fold a visible badge count into their name ("Inbox, 9"), `ui-avatar` keeps its generated name current when `alt` or `badge` arrive after the first render and includes the badge, the `ui-color-picker` trigger is named by its label and the value it shows (and no longer points `aria-labelledby` into its shadow root), and the `ui-carousel` text controls ("Back", "Forward") are named with the words they show. `ui-date-field` and `ui-time-field` name their group from `aria-label`.

**Valid ARIA**

- Roles sit on elements that allow them: `ui-card`, `ui-drawer`, the calendar grid, `ui-floating-toolbar` and `ui-quick-actions` use `div` instead of `article`, `aside` and `section`. `ui-tabs` and `ui-wizard` no longer set `aria-controls` / `aria-activedescendant` to ids in another tree. `ui-gantt` exposes a tree grid with real header, row and cell roles and a labelled timeline, `ui-placement-grid` is a list of list items, an empty `ui-sortable` list is a group rather than an empty listbox, and the sortable handle is a decorative element with no `aria-grabbed`. A custom drag handle is taken out of the tab order, since the item is the keyboard stop.
- A `ui-menu` / `ui-dropdown` trigger puts `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` on the real button inside the trigger wrapper (a `ui-button` forwards them to its inner button) instead of on a generic wrapper. `ui-switch`, `ui-toggle` and `ui-rating` no longer nest buttons inside a role-bearing host. A labelled, non-interactive `Orbiter.Item` is an image.

**Contrast**

- Muted text, status colours (success, warning, info, error) and tone accents are darker where they sat below 4.5:1, including the translucent mixes in the sidebar, menus and listbox, the solid variants of tabs, alert dialog and app header, the pressed `ui-toggle` fills and `Stat` tones. The `contrast` variants of the form controls, meter and transfer list are for dark surfaces, as before.

**Themes and layout**

- A theme that overrides `colors.surface` / `colors.background` (a dark theme) but not `surfaces` kept the baseline's light panels, so sidebars, menus and cards stayed white under light text. Unset surfaces now follow the colours the theme sets (`createThemeTokens`, `ThemeProvider`; `deriveThemeSurfaces` is exported from `@editora/ui-core/runtime`).
- `ui-data-table` and `ui-table` scroll inside their own frame instead of widening a grid or flex parent, `ui-pin-input` digits shrink on a narrow container, `ui-rating`'s label wraps, `ui-combobox`'s control no longer overflows a narrow cell, and the `ui-react` carousel indicators and the code-editor fold buttons have non-overlapping 24px targets (the carousel dots are now spaced by their padding, so they sit slightly further apart).

**Known limits**

- The built-in blue and gray accent palettes (`#0090ff`, `#8d8d8d`) put white text on a fill under 4.5:1; changing them would change the theme colours. Number-field steppers and the colour-picker hue slider are under 24px by design (the value can be typed). A link inside a `ui-switch` description is an interactive element inside a switch.
