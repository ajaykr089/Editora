Sanitise content handed to the editor before it is parsed, not only on the first edit. React's `value`, `defaultValue`, restored autosave and `setHTML`, and the web component's `data-initial-content`, restored autosave and `setContent` all assigned HTML to `innerHTML` unsanitised, so stored content such as `<img src=x onerror=…>` ran on load (and in read-only editors, which never fire an input event). These paths now use the same allowlist and opt-outs as typed input (`content.sanitize: false` or `security.sanitizeOnInput: false` keep the old behaviour). Editor-inserted embeds (`data-editora-embed`, http(s) `src`) survive a reload; other iframes are removed.

Also fixes the trusted-embed exemption in `sanitizeInputHTML`: a single trusted embed used to unlock every later `<iframe>` in the same document (including an unmarked one or one with a `javascript:` src). The decision is now made per iframe.

Note for web-component users: children placed inside `<editora-editor>` in your page's HTML are parsed by the browser before the element upgrades, so pass untrusted HTML through `data-initial-content` or `setContent()`.
