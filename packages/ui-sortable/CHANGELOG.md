### Patch Changes

- da5bebd: Fixes from a real-browser audit of the UI packages.

  **ui-react / ui-sortable:** `className` was rendered as a literal `classname` attribute on custom-element hosts under React 16-18, so it never applied (about 115 wrappers); it is now mapped to `class`. Alert, Badge, Container, ContextMenu, DataTable, EmptyState, Field, Flex, Grid, Skeleton, Table, NavigationMenu and FloatingOverlay now forward refs. `Sortable` no longer crashes while `lists`/`items` are still undefined.

  **ui-core:** invalid selectors in `item-selector`, `direct-item-selector`, portal `target` and positioner `anchor`, and negative or oversized textarea `minlength`/`maxlength`, no longer throw. The transfer list, sortable lists, tab panels, multi-select, date-time picker and colour picker expose accessible names. `<ui-sortable>`: horizontal lanes now actually lay out horizontally; dropping on an empty list or below the last card works and a release no longer commits a stale target; keys typed into controls inside a card are no longer swallowed; keyboard dragging no longer stalls with `allow-nesting="false"`; a cancelled drag no longer leaves a card faded; right-to-left lanes navigate and drop in reading order; dragging near the page edge auto-scrolls.

  **collaboration:** content received from peers can no longer execute (scripts, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs and embeds are filtered), a destroyed binding fully detaches, a caller-supplied doc is no longer destroyed, a supplied provider's own doc is used, editors without an id no longer share the empty room, and a warning is logged when the public demo server is used by default.

  **plugins:** 39 duplicate/generic ids (e.g. `id="icon"`) removed from toolbar icon SVGs.

  **core / react:** the editing surface always has an accessible name (host `aria-label`, then the placeholder, then "Rich text editor").
