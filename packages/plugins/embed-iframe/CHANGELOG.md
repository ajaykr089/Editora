# @editora/embed-iframe

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 84dc7ed: Re-release with the build output that was missing from the published packages. The CI publish workflow only built a handful of packages (`verify:release`), and `changeset publish` packs whatever is on disk, so these packages went to npm without their `dist/` folder: the latest published version of each installs but cannot be imported (`main` / `module` / `exports` point at files that are not in the tarball). `@editora/core`, `@editora/react`, `@editora/plugins`, `@editora/themes`, `@editora/ui-core`, `@editora/ui-react`, `@editora/light-code-editor` and `@editora/markdown-editor` were built and are unaffected.

  If you use one of the individual plugin packages, upgrade to this release; `@editora/plugins` (which bundles all of them) was never affected. The release workflow now builds every workspace and refuses to publish a package whose entry points are not in its tarball.

  Also: `@editora/code` and `@editora/plugins` import `@editora/light-code-editor` at runtime but did not declare it; it is now a dependency. `@editora/cli` writes its programmatic entry points (`dist/index.cjs`, `dist/index.mjs`) during `build` instead of relying on gitignored files that only existed on one machine.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- ed63c6a: Fix duplicate, stacked modal overlays when a toolbar dialog command (Insert Code Sample, Embed Content, Insert Template, Anchor, Insert Link, Insert Math) is invoked again while its dialog is already open - e.g. a double-click on the toolbar button, or clicking it again before noticing the dialog already opened. Each of these six plugins created a brand-new full-viewport overlay + dialog on every invocation with no check for an existing one, so repeated invocations left several independent overlays stacked in the DOM at once; closing the topmost one (via Escape, Cancel, or the X button) revealed another leftover dialog underneath instead of returning to the editor. Found via live-browser testing that simulated a user re-opening the same dialog rapidly. Fixed by removing/closing any existing instance of the dialog before creating a new one, matching the guard already correctly implemented in `@editora/conditional-content`, `@editora/data-binding`, `@editora/merge-tag`, `@editora/emojis`, and `@editora/version-diff`.
- a1640aa: Fix the embed-iframe plugin being completely non-functional: every inserted `<iframe>` was silently stripped back out within moments of insertion. `iframe` is deliberately excluded from the editor's default `sanitizeOnInput` allowlist - a real security boundary, since arbitrary pasted or typed content shouldn't be able to silently embed one - with a comment claiming "the embed-iframe plugin inserts iframes through its own explicit, user-initiated dialog, a different trust boundary that never calls through this sanitizer." That claim didn't hold: the plugin dispatched a plain `input` event after inserting, exactly like every other plugin's change notification, and `EditorContent`'s `handleInput` sanitizes on every `input` event unconditionally - there was no actual mechanism distinguishing the plugin's trusted insertion from arbitrary content, so the sanitizer stripped the iframe regardless.

  Found via live testing: inserting an embed through the dialog showed it for a moment, then it vanished, leaving an empty paragraph behind, with no error anywhere.

  Fixed by giving `sanitizeInputHTML` (never `sanitizePastedHTML`, so the paste boundary is unaffected) an `additionalAllowedTags` parameter, and having `EditorContent`'s `handleInput` read it from `event.detail.allowedTags` when the triggering event is a `CustomEvent` - letting one specific, already-in-the-trusted-DOM mutation keep a tag the default allowlist excludes, without reopening that tag to arbitrary input. The embed-iframe plugin now dispatches its post-insert event as `new CustomEvent('input', { detail: { allowedTags: ['iframe'] } })` instead of a plain `Event`, and `iframe` gets a dedicated entry in the attribute allowlist (src, sizing, fullscreen, scrolling/border) so the inserted embed keeps its full intended functionality rather than just surviving as a bare, unstyled frame.

  Verified live: an inserted iframe now survives with all its attributes intact, while both a simulated paste and a plain `input` event carrying a raw `<iframe>` tag are still correctly stripped - the security boundary the original design intended is now actually enforced, for arbitrary content, while the one trusted path works.

- bb57fc7: Dialog polish. Dragging out of a dialog input to select text no longer closes the dialog when the mouse is released over the backdrop (shared guard across the plugin dialogs). Dialogs use the editor's typeface instead of mixing serif and sans. Emoji and special-character category tabs are no longer clipped on phone-width viewports. The embed dialog has labelled fields and inline errors. Anchor IDs accept uppercase letters, and a11y-checker suggestions no longer swallow `<label>`/`<th>` elements.
- bb57fc7: Close several script-injection paths found in a hardening pass. The comments panel interpolated the selected document text (`range.toString()`) into `innerHTML`, so a document containing `<img onerror=…>` executed when a comment was added (stored XSS); it is now built with `textContent`. The media-manager, code-sample, math, link, emojis, template and a11y-checker dialogs interpolated alt text, link URL/title, code, formulas and search text into markup unescaped; they now escape through a shared helper, and MathML is reduced to a whitelist in an inert `DOMParser` document. The link URL field is validated in code (`javascript:`/`data:` blocked, `#anchor`, relative paths, `mailto:` and bare domains accepted). The markdown-editor preview rendered raw `marked` output unsanitised and now goes through core's DOMPurify wrapper (`@editora/core` is now a dependency of `@editora/markdown-editor`). embed-iframe validates the URL properly and shows inline errors instead of `alert()`.
- bb57fc7: Fix three `<editora-editor>` web-component bugs. Embedded iframes were stripped on the next edit because the input sanitiser removed them; embeds are now marked `data-editora-embed` and kept only on the input path after a URL check (`sanitizeHTML` and paste still strip them). A bare `readonly` attribute (`<editora-editor readonly>`) was ignored because only the literal `"true"` was recognised, leaving the editor and its commands live; boolean attributes are now on by presence, and `readonly="false"` or removing the attribute unlocks it. Editors created with `document.createElement` and given children afterwards came up empty because initial content was only captured in the constructor.
