## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- f1326f5: Ship TypeScript declarations. These packages declare `"types": "dist/index.d.ts"` in their `package.json`, but their build only produced JavaScript, so that file never existed in any published version and TypeScript users got no typings from them (TS7016, or an implicit `any`). Each package now includes a generated `dist/index.d.ts` (plus the declaration files it re-exports under `dist/_types/`), and the release workflow refuses to publish a package whose declared typings are missing.
- f1326f5: Sanitise HTML in three plugins that handled it with hand-rolled code. The preview dialog and the source-view "Save" used a blacklist on a live detached `<div>` (so `<img onerror>` ran during the cleanup, and `javascript:` links with leading whitespace, mixed case or an embedded newline kept their `href`); importing a `.docx` assigned Mammoth's unsanitised output straight into the editor, and the Word/PDF export parsed the document into a live `<div>`. They now use a shared DOMPurify-based helper (formatting, tables, links and images are kept; scripts, event handlers, `javascript:`/non-image `data:` URLs, `srcdoc`, `<style>`, forms, `<base>` and `<meta>` are removed) and an inert `DOMParser` for read-only traversal.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 84dc7ed: Re-release with the build output that was missing from the published packages. The CI publish workflow only built a handful of packages (`verify:release`), and `changeset publish` packs whatever is on disk, so these packages went to npm without their `dist/` folder: the latest published version of each installs but cannot be imported (`main` / `module` / `exports` point at files that are not in the tarball). `@editora/core`, `@editora/react`, `@editora/plugins`, `@editora/themes`, `@editora/ui-core`, `@editora/ui-react`, `@editora/light-code-editor` and `@editora/markdown-editor` were built and are unaffected.

  If you use one of the individual plugin packages, upgrade to this release; `@editora/plugins` (which bundles all of them) was never affected. The release workflow now builds every workspace and refuses to publish a package whose entry points are not in its tarball.

  Also: `@editora/code` and `@editora/plugins` import `@editora/light-code-editor` at runtime but did not declare it; it is now a dependency. `@editora/cli` writes its programmatic entry points (`dist/index.cjs`, `dist/index.mjs`) during `build` instead of relying on gitignored files that only existed on one machine.

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- ba12102: Fix "Export PDF" (and "Export Word") giving zero feedback while working, making a slow-but-working export look completely broken. `exportPdf` renders the editor content via html2canvas before building the PDF, and html2canvas's document-clone step alone can take 20-30+ seconds (it clones the whole host document, not just the target element, so cost scales with total page complexity) - during which the button did nothing: no spinner, no disabled state, not even a cursor change. A user has no way to tell a 25-second wait from a hung/broken button, especially since the command was already silent on genuine failure paths too. Found via live testing: clicking Export PDF produced no visible change for 20+ seconds before a PDF actually downloaded. Fixed by disabling the clicked toolbar button and showing an inline spinner (via the existing `__editoraLastCommandButton` toolbar-trigger tracking, so no framework-specific wiring is needed) for the duration of `exportPdf`/`exportWord`, clearing it again on completion or error.
