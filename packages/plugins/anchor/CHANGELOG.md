## 1.0.7

### Patch Changes

- f1326f5: Ship TypeScript declarations. These packages declare `"types": "dist/index.d.ts"` in their `package.json`, but their build only produced JavaScript, so that file never existed in any published version and TypeScript users got no typings from them (TS7016, or an implicit `any`). Each package now includes a generated `dist/index.d.ts` (plus the declaration files it re-exports under `dist/_types/`), and the release workflow refuses to publish a package whose declared typings are missing.

## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 84dc7ed: Re-release with the build output that was missing from the published packages. The CI publish workflow only built a handful of packages (`verify:release`), and `changeset publish` packs whatever is on disk, so these packages went to npm without their `dist/` folder: the latest published version of each installs but cannot be imported (`main` / `module` / `exports` point at files that are not in the tarball). `@editora/core`, `@editora/react`, `@editora/plugins`, `@editora/themes`, `@editora/ui-core`, `@editora/ui-react`, `@editora/light-code-editor` and `@editora/markdown-editor` were built and are unaffected.

  If you use one of the individual plugin packages, upgrade to this release; `@editora/plugins` (which bundles all of them) was never affected. The release workflow now builds every workspace and refuses to publish a package whose entry points are not in its tarball.

  Also: `@editora/code` and `@editora/plugins` import `@editora/light-code-editor` at runtime but did not declare it; it is now a dependency. `@editora/cli` writes its programmatic entry points (`dist/index.cjs`, `dist/index.mjs`) during `build` instead of relying on gitignored files that only existed on one machine.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- ed63c6a: Fix duplicate, stacked modal overlays when a toolbar dialog command (Insert Code Sample, Embed Content, Insert Template, Anchor, Insert Link, Insert Math) is invoked again while its dialog is already open - e.g. a double-click on the toolbar button, or clicking it again before noticing the dialog already opened. Each of these six plugins created a brand-new full-viewport overlay + dialog on every invocation with no check for an existing one, so repeated invocations left several independent overlays stacked in the DOM at once; closing the topmost one (via Escape, Cancel, or the X button) revealed another leftover dialog underneath instead of returning to the editor. Found via live-browser testing that simulated a user re-opening the same dialog rapidly. Fixed by removing/closing any existing instance of the dialog before creating a new one, matching the guard already correctly implemented in `@editora/conditional-content`, `@editora/data-binding`, `@editora/merge-tag`, `@editora/emojis`, and `@editora/version-diff`.
- bb57fc7: Dialog polish. Dragging out of a dialog input to select text no longer closes the dialog when the mouse is released over the backdrop (shared guard across the plugin dialogs). Dialogs use the editor's typeface instead of mixing serif and sans. Emoji and special-character category tabs are no longer clipped on phone-width viewports. The embed dialog has labelled fields and inline errors. Anchor IDs accept uppercase letters, and a11y-checker suggestions no longer swallow `<label>`/`<th>` elements.
