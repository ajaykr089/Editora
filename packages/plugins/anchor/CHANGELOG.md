## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- ed63c6a: Fix duplicate, stacked modal overlays when a toolbar dialog command (Insert Code Sample, Embed Content, Insert Template, Anchor, Insert Link, Insert Math) is invoked again while its dialog is already open - e.g. a double-click on the toolbar button, or clicking it again before noticing the dialog already opened. Each of these six plugins created a brand-new full-viewport overlay + dialog on every invocation with no check for an existing one, so repeated invocations left several independent overlays stacked in the DOM at once; closing the topmost one (via Escape, Cancel, or the X button) revealed another leftover dialog underneath instead of returning to the editor. Found via live-browser testing that simulated a user re-opening the same dialog rapidly. Fixed by removing/closing any existing instance of the dialog before creating a new one, matching the guard already correctly implemented in `@editora/conditional-content`, `@editora/data-binding`, `@editora/merge-tag`, `@editora/emojis`, and `@editora/version-diff`.
- bb57fc7: Dialog polish. Dragging out of a dialog input to select text no longer closes the dialog when the mouse is released over the backdrop (shared guard across the plugin dialogs). Dialogs use the editor's typeface instead of mixing serif and sans. Emoji and special-character category tabs are no longer clipped on phone-width viewports. The embed dialog has labelled fields and inline errors. Anchor IDs accept uppercase letters, and a11y-checker suggestions no longer swallow `<label>`/`<th>` elements.
