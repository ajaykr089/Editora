# @editora/media-manager

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 1845a93: Fix the same duplicate-stacked-overlay bug as the prior patch (see `dialog-overlay-stacking.md`) in two more plugins found during continued systematic QA: Insert Image/Video (`@editora/media-manager`) and the Accessibility Checker (`@editora/a11y-checker`, whose `toggleA11yChecker` command is misleadingly named - it always opened a new dialog rather than actually toggling one closed). Both now remove any existing instance of their dialog before creating a new one.
- bb57fc7: Dialog polish. Dragging out of a dialog input to select text no longer closes the dialog when the mouse is released over the backdrop (shared guard across the plugin dialogs). Dialogs use the editor's typeface instead of mixing serif and sans. Emoji and special-character category tabs are no longer clipped on phone-width viewports. The embed dialog has labelled fields and inline errors. Anchor IDs accept uppercase letters, and a11y-checker suggestions no longer swallow `<label>`/`<th>` elements.
- bb57fc7: Close several script-injection paths found in a hardening pass. The comments panel interpolated the selected document text (`range.toString()`) into `innerHTML`, so a document containing `<img onerror=…>` executed when a comment was added (stored XSS); it is now built with `textContent`. The media-manager, code-sample, math, link, emojis, template and a11y-checker dialogs interpolated alt text, link URL/title, code, formulas and search text into markup unescaped; they now escape through a shared helper, and MathML is reduced to a whitelist in an inert `DOMParser` document. The link URL field is validated in code (`javascript:`/`data:` blocked, `#anchor`, relative paths, `mailto:` and bare domains accepted). The markdown-editor preview rendered raw `marked` output unsanitised and now goes through core's DOMPurify wrapper (`@editora/core` is now a dependency of `@editora/markdown-editor`). embed-iframe validates the URL properly and shows inline errors instead of `alert()`.
