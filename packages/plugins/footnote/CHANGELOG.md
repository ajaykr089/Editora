## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- f1326f5: Ship TypeScript declarations. These packages declare `"types": "dist/index.d.ts"` in their `package.json`, but their build only produced JavaScript, so that file never existed in any published version and TypeScript users got no typings from them (TS7016, or an implicit `any`). Each package now includes a generated `dist/index.d.ts` (plus the declaration files it re-exports under `dist/_types/`), and the release workflow refuses to publish a package whose declared typings are missing.
- Updated dependencies [f1326f5]
  - @editora/core@1.0.19
