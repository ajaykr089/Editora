### Patch Changes

- 84dc7ed: Re-release with the build output that was missing from the published packages. The CI publish workflow only built a handful of packages (`verify:release`), and `changeset publish` packs whatever is on disk, so these packages went to npm without their `dist/` folder: the latest published version of each installs but cannot be imported (`main` / `module` / `exports` point at files that are not in the tarball). `@editora/core`, `@editora/react`, `@editora/plugins`, `@editora/themes`, `@editora/ui-core`, `@editora/ui-react`, `@editora/light-code-editor` and `@editora/markdown-editor` were built and are unaffected.

  If you use one of the individual plugin packages, upgrade to this release; `@editora/plugins` (which bundles all of them) was never affected. The release workflow now builds every workspace and refuses to publish a package whose entry points are not in its tarball.

  Also: `@editora/code` and `@editora/plugins` import `@editora/light-code-editor` at runtime but did not declare it; it is now a dependency. `@editora/cli` writes its programmatic entry points (`dist/index.cjs`, `dist/index.mjs`) during `build` instead of relying on gitignored files that only existed on one machine.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
