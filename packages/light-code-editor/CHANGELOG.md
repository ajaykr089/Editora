### Patch Changes

- 03bc707: Fix a keyboard trap: Tab indents in the editor, so a keyboard user who tabbed into it could never tab out again (every Tab press inserted indentation into the document instead), which fails WCAG 2.1.2.

  Escape now lets go of Tab, as in other code editors: after Escape, the next Tab (or Shift+Tab) is left to the browser, which moves the focus on, and the text is not touched. Any other key, or the editor losing the focus, takes the Tab key back, so nothing changes for someone who is writing. An Escape that something else handled (the find panel, a menu, a listener that prevented its default) does not count.

- 9164376: Fix line numbers with `lineWrapping`: they did not follow wrapped lines. Every line number was one row tall, but a line that wraps is several rows, so from the first wrapped line on the numbers drifted up against the text, and the gutter ended (at the last line number) while the text carried on below it; in a long document the last numbers sat beside text from far earlier in the file. A number now sits at the first row of its line, and is as tall as the line is.

  The editor finds how many rows each line wraps to by laying the same text out one block per line in a hidden copy of the content (one layout pass, once per task), and measures again when the text changes (even if the number of lines does not) and when the editor is resized or shown. After an edit only the lines it changed are laid out again, and a line keeps its height until its text, the width or the font changes, so typing in a long document stays cheap; the gutter keeps its rows too, adding or dropping them at the end instead of building them all again, and writes only the heights that changed. Line and gutter decorations (the active line, markers) and `scrollToPosition` are placed by those measured positions too, so they land on the right line when lines wrap. Without `lineWrapping`, nothing is measured and nothing changes. While folded blocks are on screen the lines cannot be matched to numbers and each stays one row, as before.

  The package now has a test suite (`npm test`).

## 1.0.16

### Patch Changes

- ac24c10: An accessibility and layout pass over the UI components, measured with axe-core over all 602 Storybook stories (292 stories had violations; none remain). The names pass from the previous release stays at 0 unnamed controls.

  **Descriptions and names now reach the control**

  - A `ui-field` description and error were pointed at with ids inside the field's shadow root, which the control can never follow. The field now puts their text on the control as `aria-description`. `ui-input`, `ui-textarea`, `ui-number-field`, `ui-password-field`, `ui-tags-input`, `ui-combobox`, `ui-select`, `ui-multi-select`, `ui-pin-input`, `ui-date-field`, `ui-time-field` and the date pickers forward it (and an `aria-describedby` the author put on the host) to the element inside them. `ui-tags-input` now wires its own description and error too.
  - `ui-dock` items fold a visible badge count into their name ("Inbox, 9"), `ui-avatar` keeps its generated name current when `alt` or `badge` arrive after the first render and includes the badge, the `ui-color-picker` trigger is named by its label and the value it shows (and no longer points `aria-labelledby` into its shadow root), and the `ui-carousel` text controls ("Back", "Forward") are named with the words they show. `ui-date-field` and `ui-time-field` name their group from `aria-label`.

  **Valid ARIA**

  - Roles sit on elements that allow them: `ui-card`, `ui-drawer`, the calendar grid, `ui-floating-toolbar` and `ui-quick-actions` use `div` instead of `article`, `aside` and `section`. `ui-tabs` and `ui-wizard` no longer set `aria-controls` / `aria-activedescendant` to ids in another tree. `ui-gantt` exposes a tree grid with real header, row and cell roles and a labelled timeline, `ui-placement-grid` is a list of list items, an empty `ui-sortable` list is a group rather than an empty listbox, and the sortable handle is a decorative element with no `aria-grabbed`. A custom drag handle is taken out of the tab order, since the item is the keyboard stop.
  - A `ui-menu` / `ui-dropdown` trigger puts `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` on the real button inside the trigger wrapper (a `ui-button` forwards them to its inner button) instead of on a generic wrapper. `ui-switch`, `ui-toggle` and `ui-rating` no longer nest buttons inside a role-bearing host. A labelled, non-interactive `Orbiter.Item` is an image.

  **Contrast**

  - Muted text, status colours (success, warning, info, error) and tone accents are darker where they sat below 4.5:1, including the translucent mixes in the sidebar, menus and listbox, the solid variants of tabs, alert dialog and app header, the pressed `ui-toggle` fills, the `ui-animated-text` info tone and `Stat` tones. The `contrast` variants of the form controls, meter and transfer list are for dark surfaces, as before.
  - **Text on a solid fill follows the theme.** `ui-button` drew white text on its primary fill whatever the theme said, so the library's own default theme (amber `#ffc53d`) gave white on amber at 1.6:1. It now uses the theme's on-primary colour (`--ui-color-foreground-on-primary`), and `ui-toggle`, `ui-switch`, `ui-tabs` and `ui-select`, which read a variable the theme never set, fall back to it. The built-in accent palettes pick a text colour that reads at 4.5:1 (`blue` and `gray` now use near-black on their fill instead of white at 3.3:1; the fill colours are unchanged), and a theme that changes `colors.primary` without a text colour gets one derived from it instead of keeping amber's dark one (`createThemeTokens`, `ThemeProvider`; `readableForeground` and `deriveForegroundOnPrimary` are exported from `@editora/ui-core/runtime`). A text colour you set yourself is kept.
  - Secondary and ghost `ui-button` text takes more of the text colour, soft buttons mix their tint with the theme's surface instead of white (they were light panels in a dark theme), and the contrast `ui-sidebar`'s active item has a darker fill so its white label reads.

  **Themes and layout**

  - A theme that overrides `colors.surface` / `colors.background` (a dark theme) but not `surfaces` kept the baseline's light panels, so sidebars, menus and cards stayed white under light text. Unset surfaces now follow the colours the theme sets (`createThemeTokens`, `ThemeProvider`; `deriveThemeSurfaces` is exported from `@editora/ui-core/runtime`).
  - `ui-data-table` and `ui-table` scroll inside their own frame instead of widening a grid or flex parent, `ui-pin-input` digits shrink on a narrow container, `ui-rating`'s label wraps, `ui-combobox`'s control no longer overflows a narrow cell, and the `ui-react` carousel indicators and the code-editor fold buttons have non-overlapping 24px targets (the carousel dots are now spaced by their padding, so they sit slightly further apart).
  - **`ui-number-field` steppers are side by side** (decrease, then increase) and as tall as the field instead of stacked at about 20px each, and the `ui-color-picker` hue and alpha sliders have a 24px hit area around the same 12px track. `ui-react`'s `Dock.Item` separates its label and badge with a space.
  - **`@editora/light-code-editor` lines are 24px tall (they were 21px)**, and its fold column is 24px wide, so the fold buttons are 24x24 targets that no longer overlap when two consecutive lines fold (WCAG 2.5.8). Code is about 14% airier; line numbers, decorations and folding all follow the one line-height constant.
  - **`ui-calendar`**: a day's button holds only the day number, and its event marks and tooltip are drawn beside it in the same `.day-cell` (the marks are `aria-hidden`; the events stay in the tooltip the button's `aria-describedby` points at). The text shown on the button is then part of its name. The tooltip, which was clipped by the button and never visible, now shows on hover and focus, opening inward at the edge columns. An unusable `locale` falls back to `en-US` instead of leaving the calendar empty.
  - **An interactive `ui-card` is named from all the text it shows**, in the order it is drawn (it was the title only, so the description shown on the card was not part of its name); `ui-react`'s `Card` puts a space between its sections so that text does not run together. A disabled `ui-number-field` or `ui-multi-select` marks its shell `aria-disabled`, so the suffix, chips and steppers in it are inactive like the input.

  **Known limit**

  - A link or button inside a `ui-switch` is an interactive element inside `role="switch"`, which is invalid ARIA; the docs now say to keep them beside the switch (the click guard still works for existing markup).

## 1.0.15

### Patch Changes

- bb57fc7: Fix several ways of losing content. Table: Select All then Insert Table replaced the whole document. Checklist: converting loose root-level text deleted it. Link: a multi-block selection was flattened into a single plain-text `<a>`; it now links per block. code-sample: blocks decayed into a stray "Copy" text node with dead handlers after the first keystroke; they are now `<pre data-lang><code>` with delegated handlers. translation-workflow: unlocking made segments editable in read-only editors. light-code-editor: Backspace beside an emoji left a lone surrogate, Tab replaced a multi-line selection with spaces (it now indents/outdents lines), Replace All needed one Undo per match, and Alt/Cmd+Backspace deleted a single character. markdown-editor: the rich editor remounted on every keystroke and lost focus, and the toolbar inserted a literal `\n`.
